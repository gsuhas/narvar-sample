I tend to write myself little notes in my notebook or on a post-it as I pick up something new. As you can imagine, this does not make it very easy to reference something I have learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, I was going to add a simple, blog-type of section for these short posts. I realized that \u003ca href=\"https://hashrocket.com/\"\u003eHashrocket\u003c/a\u003e has open-sourced \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex\"\u003eTilex\u003c/a\u003e and encourages people to fork and use it. So that is exactly what I decided to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a few options for making use of Tilex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI could create a separate Heroku application to host it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI could merge it into my personal site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI could turn my site into an umbrella app.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have yet to do anything with an umbrella app so I decided to take this opportunity to learn by doing. It also seemed like the more challenging of the options. Not so coincidentally, it also makes for a good blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have created a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/tbex-tutorial\"\u003eseparate repo\u003c/a\u003e for my personal site and its integration with Tilex. It will allow you to see everything I did without being muddied by all the commits it took to get things working the first time around (mostly due to errors of my own doing). Each section will have a link to the GitHub commit(s) for the code used in the section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePresumptions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy domain provider is Google Domains and my webhost is Heroku. Anything that relates to those may be different for your provider and webhost. Be aware that both of the apps I am using as an example are using Phoenix 1.3 and have pretty default structures. Keep that mind if you are using an older version of Phoenix or have modified your app’s structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the gists, you will see your_app, YourApp, or YourAppWeb from time to time. Be sure to rename those to the name of your app. For me, that means using tbe_elixirr, TbeElixir, or TbeElixirWeb. You will see reminders for this from time to time (mostly in places where I forgot to do it myself).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCreate a Subdomain Plug (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/tbex-tutorial/commit/88367f2aa400b53aa4500d18ed7a06dc58705ae8\"\u003e88367f2\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are going to create a new plug that will route our application based on what subdomain it used. When visitors visit our til subdomain, they will be routed to the Tilex app. Be sure to rename YourAppWeb.Plug.Til to the name of your app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/60a76792add75f10ab84a3ada3e79212/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/60a76792add75f10ab84a3ada3e79212/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext, we will add this plug to our endpoint.ex.

I had to create a CNAME record with Google that pointed to my Heroku DNS target. You can add your subdomain to Heroku using heroku domains:add til.yourdomain.com from your terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCreate the Umbrella (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/tbex-tutorial/commit/54ed755c5c903392cbca847bec0554a01d62cbe0\"\u003e54ed755\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/tbex-tutorial/commit/d0bda32222e7650e7912e18a59ee73d24aef2812\"\u003ed0bda32\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to first create an apps folder in our root directory. Inside the apps folder, we will create another folder and give it the same name as our app. This is important. If the folder name does not match the app name, the app will not be found when our app is run. If you have any doubts, you can look inside your mix.exs, and right at the top is a project function. You will see app: :your_app. Name your folder exactly as your_app is shown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn your root directory, move all of the files in your application to the folder you just created. I left behind the README.md, the Procfile which is used for deploying my app to Heroku, and all of the hidden dotfiles such as .git and .env. I also left behind the .gitignore and copied it into my new project directory. Alternatively, you could modify your root .gitignore to include the correct subdirectories but copying it over helps us move along quicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the apps folder, we will add Tilex. Fork it from \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex\"\u003ehashrocket/tilex\u003c/a\u003e on GitHub, and clone your fork into your apps folder. Per the instructions, we will also need to run mix deps.get, mix ecto.setup, and npm install --prefix assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince our fork of Tilex has its own repo, we will want to create a submodule to link it with our main app. This ensures that when we commit to our repo (and push our code to production), our Tilex fork is included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo create the submodule, enter the below command in your terminal, at the root directory, replacing \u0026lt;url\u0026gt; with your Tilex fork git url. To avoid any complications, use the https version of the URL and make sure your Tilex fork is not a private repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/b5e5e686025d8f98ae6e556ecbb364a6/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/b5e5e686025d8f98ae6e556ecbb364a6/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have already committed your code, you may get an error stating ‘apps/tilex’ already exists in the index. This happens because our repo already has a reference to apps/tilex. You can remove this reference with git rm --cached apps/tilex. If you run git submodule add \u0026lt;url\u0026gt; apps/tilex again, it will add your submodule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will create a .gitmodules file that links the two git repos. If you visit your git repo after the next time you commit your code and look inside the apps folder, you should see a directory name similar to tilex @4e6c8dc. That is your link from your main repo to your Tilex repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need a mix.exs and a config/config.exs in our root directory so let’s add those. You can replace Umbrella with whatever name you would like it to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/cb223604e1559491bd459d9a8fc49d79/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/cb223604e1559491bd459d9a8fc49d79/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/d44550b6a3772ca97fffa7662db04cad/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/d44550b6a3772ca97fffa7662db04cad/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince this is an umbrella app, we need to have our main app and Tilex share the same build, config, and lock files. To do this, we will add the following four lines to apps/your_app/mix.exs and apps/tilex/mix.exs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/0b86a8f08f8ce98c9f2e11b00fad4589/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/0b86a8f08f8ce98c9f2e11b00fad4589/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe will add it to the end of the project function at the top of the file.

The mix.lock and deps directory in our root is a combination of all the dependencies from our main app and Tilex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince we will be running two apps at the same time, we need to ensure they are running on separate ports in development (the til.ex plug will handle things on the production side).

I tend to write myself little notes in my notebook or on a post-it as I pick up something new. As you can imagine, this does not make it very easy to reference something I have learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, I was going to add a simple, blog-type of section for these short posts. I realized that \u003ca href=\"https://hashrocket.com/\"\u003eHashrocket\u003c/a\u003e has open-sourced \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex\"\u003eTilex\u003c/a\u003e and encourages people to fork and use it. So that is exactly what I decided to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a few options for making use of Tilex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI could create a separate Heroku application to host it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI could merge it into my personal site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI could turn my site into an umbrella app.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have yet to do anything with an umbrella app so I decided to take this opportunity to learn by doing. It also seemed like the more challenging of the options. Not so coincidentally, it also makes for a good blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have created a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/tbex-tutorial\"\u003eseparate repo\u003c/a\u003e for my personal site and its integration with Tilex. It will allow you to see everything I did without being muddied by all the commits it took to get things working the first time around (mostly due to errors of my own doing). Each section will have a link to the GitHub commit(s) for the code used in the section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePresumptions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy domain provider is Google Domains and my webhost is Heroku. Anything that relates to those may be different for your provider and webhost. Be aware that both of the apps I am using as an example are using Phoenix 1.3 and have pretty default structures. Keep that mind if you are using an older version of Phoenix or have modified your app’s structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the gists, you will see your_app, YourApp, or YourAppWeb from time to time. Be sure to rename those to the name of your app. For me, that means using tbe_elixirr, TbeElixir, or TbeElixirWeb. You will see reminders for this from time to time (mostly in places where I forgot to do it myself).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCreate a Subdomain Plug (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/tbex-tutorial/commit/88367f2aa400b53aa4500d18ed7a06dc58705ae8\"\u003e88367f2\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are going to create a new plug that will route our application based on what subdomain it used.

I had to create a CNAME record with Google that pointed to my Heroku DNS target. You can add your subdomain to Heroku using heroku domains:add til.yourdomain.com from your terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCreate the Umbrella (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/tbex-tutorial/commit/54ed755c5c903392cbca847bec0554a01d62cbe0\"\u003e54ed755\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/tbex-tutorial/commit/d0bda32222e7650e7912e18a59ee73d24aef2812\"\u003ed0bda32\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to first create an apps folder in our root directory. Inside the apps folder, we will create another folder and give it the same name as our app. This is important. If the folder name does not match the app name, the app will not be found when our app is run. If you have any doubts, you can look inside your mix.exs, and right at the top is a project function. You will see app: :your_app. Name your folder exactly as your_app is shown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn your root directory, move all of the files in your application to the folder you just created. I left behind the README.md, the Procfile which is used for deploying my app to Heroku, and all of the hidden dotfiles such as .git and .env. I also left behind the .gitignore and copied it into my new project directory. Alternatively, you could modify your root .gitignore to include the correct subdirectories but copying it over helps us move along quicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the apps folder, we will add Tilex. Fork it from \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex\"\u003ehashrocket/tilex\u003c/a\u003e on GitHub, and clone your fork into your apps folder. Per the instructions, we will also need to run mix deps.get, mix ecto.setup, and npm install --prefix assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince our fork of Tilex has its own repo, we will want to create a submodule to link it with our main app. This ensures that when we commit to our repo (and push our code to production), our Tilex fork is included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo create the submodule, enter the below command in your terminal, at the root directory, replacing \u0026lt;url\u0026gt; with your Tilex fork git url. To avoid any complications, use the https version of the URL and make sure your Tilex fork is not a private repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/b5e5e686025d8f98ae6e556ecbb364a6/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/b5e5e686025d8f98ae6e556ecbb364a6/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have already committed your code, you may get an error stating ‘apps/tilex’ already exists in the index. This happens because our repo already has a reference to apps/tilex. You can remove this reference with git rm --cached apps/tilex. If you run git submodule add \u0026lt;url\u0026gt; apps/tilex again, it will add your submodule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will create a .gitmodules file that links the two git repos. If you visit your git repo after the next time you commit your code and look inside the apps folder, you should see a directory name similar to tilex @4e6c8dc. That is your link from your main repo to your Tilex repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need a mix.exs and a config/config.exs in our root directory so let’s add those.

Even though they are vastly different, I think the similarities helped me pick up the language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter building the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/vidshare\"\u003efirst app\u003c/a\u003e on my own, I decided I wanted to write a series of blog posts walking someone through doing the same. You can find that series of blog posts here: \u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-1-the-setup-6626264be03\"\u003ehttps://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-1-the-setup-6626264be03\u003c/a\u003e. The original version was using Phoenix 1.2 and I have just updated it to using Phoenix 1.3. This was a lot of work as I rebuilt the app and took the time to give it some much needed refactoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy the tutorial\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a couple of main reasons I decided to write the tutorial. Most tutorials I came across ignored writing tests (this was true with Ruby on Rails as well). If you were lucky they might dedicate a small section to talking about testing. This is a disservice to those going through the tutorial. A well tested app is very important. It comes in especially handy when you decide to do some large scale refactoring. My tutorial will be writing tests for all that we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy writing the tutorial, it gave me an opportunity to think more about what I was doing and better understand it. It also gave me chances to see areas to improve between writing out what I was doing and creating the GitHub gists for sharing the code. There are things I could have easily missed if I was only trying to finish a part of the app and move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gained a new appreciation along the way for those who have written books and full-fledged courses. This nine-part blog series took a lot of time but it is only a drop in the bucket compared to what those take. A big thank you to anyone that has ever written a programming book or full-fledged course (unless you excluded testing ;) ).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eBrief summary of the tutorial\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-1-the-setup-6626264be03\"\u003ePart 1: The Setup\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brief walkthrough of creating our app and setting up our database. In the event you do not have Elixir, Phoenix, or Postgres installed on your local machine, I have included links to help. We will fire up our server to see our “Welcome to Phoenix!” homepage, and see the tests our app created for us all pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-2-using-foundation-6f9fa13817f5\"\u003ePart 2: Using Foundation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you create a Phoenix app, it comes with Bootstrap built in. This makes it easy to get off and running with a CSS framework. I wanted to mix things up and use a framework I have not used before. After being unsuccessful getting Semantic UI to work, I switched to using Foundation. It would have been really simple to drop cdn links in our app.html.eex. However, by taking the approach of using npm to install, it gives us an additional learning opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-3-homepage-navbar-and-errors-3f5b247f5d8e\"\u003ePart 3: Homepage, Navbar, and Errors\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get a little bit into editing our default tests in this section. We will also write our very first test. We strip out all of the boilerplate that came with Phoenix, and add our own code for the index.html.eex. This includes our background image and a navbar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-4-using-google-%C3%BCberauth-e7d2ed1a3541\"\u003ePart 4: Using Google Überauth\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this section, we will set our app up to sign users in with Google. It could just as easily be Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, etc. I chose Google because we are doing YouTube videos, and I have never used Google for signing in before. Like using Foundation, I wanted to try something new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe write a couple of new tests in this section for signing in with Google. We also create our first context. If you are unfamiliar with contexts, they are the replacement for models with Phoenix 1.3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-5-setting-a-current-user-43b90c7468d5\"\u003ePart 5: Setting a Current User\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike any good app, when a user is signed in, we want to know about it so we can tailor how the site looks. For example, a signed in user does not need to see a “Sign in with Google” link but rather a “Sign out” link. This also sets us up for later when we want to make sure you only see a delete button for videos that you have added. We will be creating our first plug in this section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-6-using-the-youtube-api-5ff58082088e\"\u003ePart 6: Using the YouTube API\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will be using the YouTube API to take a submitted URL and turn it into an embedded video. This saves the user from having to input each part of the video information to add it. We will also be adding more tests to ensure our functionality is working as expected. The YouTube API returns the data in JSON so we use HTTPoison and Poison to parse and decode that data into something easier to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-7-setting-up-authorizations-d5460ff53f0e\"\u003ePart 7: Setting Up Authorizations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have users adding videos, we want to make sure only signed in users can add them, and you can only delete videos you have added. Imagine the chaos that would ensue without these checks in place. We will be creating a plug to handle this. However, unlike last time, we will be limiting the plug to be used only for certain pages. This will be accomplished by adding an additional pipeline and scope to our router.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-8-making-things-look-nicer-2d785d13b405\"\u003ePart 8: Making Things Look Nicer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur back-end work is pretty much completed but our pages do not look that great. Our index page is a basic table and our show page does not have the embedded video. We take care of both of those issues as well as adding a test for our show page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-9-search-sort-pagination-25acb7928872\"\u003ePart 9: Search, Sort, Pagination\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor our final step, we will add search, sort, and pagination to our index page. We do not want to have hundreds of videos showing up all at once. Being able to sort and search the videos will make it easier to find what we want as we are limited the amount of videos shown at one time. There is also a link to deploying the app to Heroku if you so choose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive the tutorial a whirl and let me know what you think.

SendGrid is an example of one and I utilized their service for sending emails from within the app. The capturing of emails and sending of the newsletter was all handled in the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/newsletter-code-challenge\"\u003ethe code on my GitHub\u003c/a\u003e. Against what I should have done, I skipped adding tests until after. I had a deadline and needed to get it done. I did not know enough of testing in Elixir and felt learning that and writing the app in my 48 hours would have been a problem. Now that I am more familiar with Elixir and writing its test, I can feel confident that writing tests first would not slow me down. After all, TDD is my preferred way to code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSigning up for the newsletter\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first task was for a visitor to the site to see a form requesting their email address. It would have been easy to create a simple form to grab the email address and add it to the database. However, I was looking ahead to being able to send an email to confirm the subscription. It seemed to me the easiest way would be to use an authentication system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/smpallen99/coherence\"\u003eCoherence\u003c/a\u003e as it had the email confirmation system that I wanted. I figured it would be easy enough to tweak it so instead of needing a name, email, and password to sign up, you would only need an email. It was not easy. Well, it ultimately was but it took me a long time to get to that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first ran the Coherence install, I ended up with a user module and migration that looked like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/23a4460759c036e241d5437e99174cad/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/23a4460759c036e241d5437e99174cad/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem I ran into that took up so much of my time, was the eliminating of a password from being needed. I tried removing it from the migration, following the validate_coherence(params) function and removing any password references it led to, but everything I did kept kicking back one error or another. I could not seem to track down where the password was getting set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending way too much time on it, I decided to keep in the password field and much like the name field I kept, set a default value in the migration and schema. This of course also failed because of some of the same reasons as above. There were things Coherence was doing that I did not quite understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eventually decided that I needed to get moving on to the next step. I started passing in a password using a hidden form field as a temporary measure. A terrible approach but sufficient for now until I get the rest of the app finished. Make things work then make things better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing a hidden field for the password was eventually removed when I discovered a solution while working on changing an admin’s password in iex. It turned out by simply removing validate_coherence(params) from the user.ex changeset/2, passwords would default to nil, and a user would never be able to sign in without having their password changed manually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/95aaa1f5168906e9e39763c2042fb8de/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/95aaa1f5168906e9e39763c2042fb8de/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003ch4\u003eEmail confirmations\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the bonus points was an email being sent out to confirm a subscription. Coherence has this baked in and was pretty easy to follow their docs and implement. Putting my app on Heroku allows for a free SendGrid account that allows for 12,000 sent emails a month. I will later make use of a lot of those to test things out. Coherence had instructions for setting up a SendGrid adapter and making sure confirmation emails were going out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSending out a newsletter\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I need to have an admin be able to send out a newsletter to all the subscribers. One problem here is all my users have the same fake password that is passed in by the hidden form field. Anyone that would have inspected the source of the page could see it and use the password to log in and send out emails. That is not something we want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst step I took was adding a role to all of the users. It would default to subscriber and the admin would have to be changed by using iex to get into the database. Not something you would want in a production app but good enough for the purpose of this code challenge. I was able to add a role and set the default easily enough by tweaking the migration and user.ex to add the extra field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI signed up for an account with the address I would use as my admin and clicked the email confirmation link to confirm the account. I used iex to update the role to admin and created a page only accessible to those whose role was admin. This would bounce any user who managed to get a hold of their hidden input field password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI created a form that had a subject and body field. It posted to my newsletter_controller :create and off my emails went! This process is currently way too slow, 5,000 emails took 5 seconds to process from the time I clicked send to the time I got the flash message telling me it was successful. This is an area for large improvements. There is this great post I saw called “\u003ca href=\"http://engineering.teacherspayteachers.com/2017/08/02/reducing-elixir-backend-time-from-120ms-to-20ms-with-parallelization.html\"\u003eReducing Elixir Backend Time from 120ms to 20ms With Parallelization\u003c/a\u003e” which really shows how great Elixir can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/81b4b4e106b5905d962e73b189f845f6/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/81b4b4e106b5905d962e73b189f845f6/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eI mirrored my newsletter_email.ex after Coherence’s user_email.ex. This is essentially the same process used to send the confirmation emails. It takes the user and gets their name and email, and grabs the subject and body from the params.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThings to improve\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app is not perfect by any means. I would have liked to have the newsletter be able to be scheduled as per one of the bonus points. I also would have liked to have a few more tests for things like invalid data with the signups and log ins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I mentioned before, I really want to dive deeper into speeding up the sending of the newsletter. Receiving the confirmation flash message should be basically instant after I click send.

Keep in mind that in a real-life scenario, there may be 10–100k subscribers, so sending emails in a synchronous way (e.g. calling a send_mail(email, body) function while looping all the subscribers) is not a valid option.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus points if:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSubscription is confirmed by sending an email with a ‘Confirm your subscription’ link\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA newsletter can be scheduled to be sent at any time in the future (usually, newsletters are sent in a biweekly or monthly schedule)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAutomated testing is included\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was not specified, I ignored how easy it would be to capture email addresses and send a newsletter through any of the number of systems available. SendGrid is an example of one and I utilized their service for sending emails from within the app. The capturing of emails and sending of the newsletter was all handled in the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/thebrianemory/newsletter-code-challenge\"\u003ethe code on my GitHub\u003c/a\u003e. Against what I should have done, I skipped adding tests until after. I had a deadline and needed to get it done. I did not know enough of testing in Elixir and felt learning that and writing the app in my 48 hours would have been a problem. Now that I am more familiar with Elixir and writing its test, I can feel confident that writing tests first would not slow me down. After all, TDD is my preferred way to code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSigning up for the newsletter\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first task was for a visitor to the site to see a form requesting their email address. It would have been easy to create a simple form to grab the email address and add it to the database. However, I was looking ahead to being able to send an email to confirm the subscription. It seemed to me the easiest way would be to use an authentication system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/smpallen99/coherence\"\u003eCoherence\u003c/a\u003e as it had the email confirmation system that I wanted. I figured it would be easy enough to tweak it so instead of needing a name, email, and password to sign up, you would only need an email. It was not easy. Well, it ultimately was but it took me a long time to get to that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first ran the Coherence install, I ended up with a user module and migration that looked like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/23a4460759c036e241d5437e99174cad/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/23a4460759c036e241d5437e99174cad/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem I ran into that took up so much of my time, was the eliminating of a password from being needed. I tried removing it from the migration, following the validate_coherence(params) function and removing any password references it led to, but everything I did kept kicking back one error or another. I could not seem to track down where the password was getting set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending way too much time on it, I decided to keep in the password field and much like the name field I kept, set a default value in the migration and schema. This of course also failed because of some of the same reasons as above. There were things Coherence was doing that I did not quite understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eventually decided that I needed to get moving on to the next step. I started passing in a password using a hidden form field as a temporary measure. A terrible approach but sufficient for now until I get the rest of the app finished. Make things work then make things better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing a hidden field for the password was eventually removed when I discovered a solution while working on changing an admin’s password in iex. It turned out by simply removing validate_coherence(params) from the user.ex changeset/2, passwords would default to nil, and a user would never be able to sign in without having their password changed manually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/95aaa1f5168906e9e39763c2042fb8de/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/95aaa1f5168906e9e39763c2042fb8de/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003ch4\u003eEmail confirmations\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the bonus points was an email being sent out to confirm a subscription. Coherence has this baked in and was pretty easy to follow their docs and implement. Putting my app on Heroku allows for a free SendGrid account that allows for 12,000 sent emails a month. I will later make use of a lot of those to test things out. Coherence had instructions for setting up a SendGrid adapter and making sure confirmation emails were going out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSending out a newsletter\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I need to have an admin be able to send out a newsletter to all the subscribers. One problem here is all my users have the same fake password that is passed in by the hidden form field. Anyone that would have inspected the source of the page could see it and use the password to log in and send out emails. That is not something we want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst step I took was adding a role to all of the users. It would default to subscriber and the admin would have to be changed by using iex to get into the database. Not something you would want in a production app but good enough for the purpose of this code challenge. I was able to add a role and set the default easily enough by tweaking the migration and user.ex to add the extra field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI signed up for an account with the address I would use as my admin and clicked the email confirmation link to confirm the account. I used iex to update the role to admin and created a page only accessible to those whose role was admin. This would bounce any user who managed to get a hold of their hidden input field password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI created a form that had a subject and body field. It posted to my newsletter_controller :create and off my emails went! This process is currently way too slow, 5,000 emails took 5 seconds to process from the time I clicked send to the time I got the flash message telling me it was successful. This is an area for large improvements. There is this great post I saw called “\u003ca href=\"http://engineering.teacherspayteachers.com/2017/08/02/reducing-elixir-backend-time-from-120ms-to-20ms-with-parallelization.html\"\u003eReducing Elixir Backend Time from 120ms to 20ms With Parallelization\u003c/a\u003e” which really shows how great Elixir can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/81b4b4e106b5905d962e73b189f845f6/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/81b4b4e106b5905d962e73b189f845f6/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eI mirrored my newsletter_email.ex after Coherence’s user_email.ex. This is essentially the same process used to send the confirmation emails. It takes the user and gets their name and email, and grabs the subject and body from the params.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThings to improve\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app is not perfect by any means. I would have liked to have the newsletter be able to be scheduled as per one of the bonus points. I also would have liked to have a few more tests for things like invalid data with the signups and log ins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I mentioned before, I really want to dive deeper into speeding up the sending of the newsletter. Receiving the confirmation flash message should be basically instant after I click send. No reason it should take five seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look forward to learning more about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow me on Twitter \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thebrianemory\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e@thebrianemory\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.

In \u003cem\u003eMastering Phoenix Framework, \u003c/em\u003eyou learn about Phoenix using TDD. In \u003cem\u003eGaruda\u003c/em\u003e, you learn how to build your own Phoenix framework clone to get a better understanding of how it all works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have only scratched the surface of \u003cem\u003eMastering Phoenix Framework\u003c/em\u003e and I can already tell it is going to be a fantastic resource. You build an ecommerce site using Elixir and Phoenix 1.3-rc2, soon to be updated to 1.3, and it is all done using TDD (yay!). You will deploy it in a variety of methods using Mix, Distillery release and Distillery release with Docker. The site will utilize i18n so the site can be viewed in English, French, and German.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWrite more blog posts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have not been very good lately with writing blog posts. This will be my first one in two and a half months. I want to write more regularly and will aim for one a week. I should have plenty to write and talk about with all of this Elixir learning and programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate my Elixir tutorial blog posts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last blog post I wrote was a series of them about \u003ca href=\"https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-1-the-setup-6626264be03\"\u003ecreating an Elixir Phoenix app\u003c/a\u003e. The combination of learning more about Elixir and Phoenix, and their versions being upgraded tells me I need to go back and update the posts. This goes hand in hand with my next list item\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate VidShare\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eVidShare is a simple app designed to make it easy to share YouTube or Vimeo videos even if they are private. Simply add the URL and the app takes care of the rest. This is a spinoff of my Rails app Flatcasts. At some point, I would like to expand on it so it would have organizations and users to keep your videos private to your team. I want to go back and update this to use Phoenix 1.3, add some more tests, and tidy up the code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemake personal site\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy \u003ca href=\"https://www.brianemory.com/\"\u003epersonal site\u003c/a\u003e is currently a simple little Rails app. I want to rewrite it in Elixir and give it a little bit of an overhaul. Nothing too crazy but change the copy and the layout of the projects section. Then again, I really like the simplicity of this site by \u003ca href=\"http://gregorymcintyre.com/\"\u003eGregory McIntyre\u003c/a\u003e so a massive overhaul could also happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApply for every Elixir job\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis part of things will start very soon.

However, I was not really happy with it. It was about that time I started learning Elixir. Naturally, I wanted to build an Elixir version and add more features that she would like to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, Resume\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I touched on in the Applying for every Elixir Job section, I have some updates that need done to these sites and my resume. I want to reflect my current focus on Elixir, and better present myself and my projects. There are projects I want to remove from there and projects I want to be more at the forefront. A good example would be my open source Ruby gem \u003ca href=\"https://thebrianemory.github.io/corneal/\"\u003eCorneal\u003c/a\u003e that was featured in \u003ca href=\"http://rubyweekly.com/issues/353\"\u003eRuby Weekly #353\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreate a Bob’s Burger API\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the show Bob’s Burgers.

I thought that was pretty amazing. I decided that building an extensive API like that would be a great project to undertake. I was wondering what movie or show I could base mine off of and Bob’s Burgers was the first to come to mind. It will be a lot of fun researching all the data needed and creating a great API using Phoenix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThere you have it!\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is my plan for the next two months.

We will create this in our assets/css directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the background image, you can grab one from \u003ca href=\"https://pixabay.com/\"\u003ehttps://pixabay.com\u003c/a\u003e, rename it to cat.jpg, and place it in your assets/static/images folder.

This keeps it out of the main app template and makes refactoring easier in the future. We will first write a test that verifies that our navigation bar is loading. Similar to the page_controller test, we will visit the homepage, and expect to find our navbar.

This is where you are able to see both the mobile and desktop elements at once for a brief second before the page loads. Inside our custom.css we can fix this by adding the following code at the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/media/72bb783834d8658b0992f334120ee8f3/href\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/media/72bb783834d8658b0992f334120ee8f3/href\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have your server running and looking at the homepage, you may notice a slight gap between the picture and the navigation bar.

These were set up for us when we created the app and default to using Bootstrap classes. The gap between our image and navigation bar on the homepage is because we are missing a small bit of CSS to hide an empty alert that was removed with our phoenix.css file.
